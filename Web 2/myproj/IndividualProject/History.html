                <h3>History of Sequoia National Park</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Sequoia National Park is America's second oldest national park. Western Mono Native Americans settled the western foothils as well as the upper parts of the mountain. Another tribe called the Yokuts settled the foothills and parts of the lower valley. In the 1860's European settlers arrived and settled there as farmers. Then the Sierra became a popular destination for trappers and hunters and they would frequently come and hunt the wildlife to sell furs and meat back to the eastern U.S.</p><br><br>
                
                <p>
                    As loggers and other settlers started to move into the area widespread deforestation, fires, and erosion started to destroy the land. John Muir, a conservationist, was a driving force for getting the Yosemite and Seqouia area included into the the national park system as he witnessed the devastating effects humans had on nature. In 1890 he petitioned to inlcude both area's into the national park system. He frequently published essays on nature preservation, founded the Sierra club, is referred to as the "father of the national parks", and was one of the writer's that later influenced president Kennedy's creation of the Conservation Corps.

                <p>The park is home to five of the ten world's largest trees in the fabled Giant Forest. It is also the home of the General Sherman Tree which it the largest living single stem tree in the world standing at an impressive 275 feet tall.</p><br><br>
